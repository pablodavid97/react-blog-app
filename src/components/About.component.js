            <section>
                <p>
                    Hi there! I’m Pablo Llanes, a passionate software developer
                    based in Quito. With a focus on web technologies, I
                    specialize in creating interactive and user-friendly web
                    applications. My journey in tech has been both exciting and
                    challenging, and I'm enjoying the process.
                </p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science Engineering
                    from Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ). Over the
                    years, I have honed my skills in various technologies,
                    including React, TypeScript, and Node.js. My goal is to
                    continuously learn and adapt to the latest tendencies in the
                    market while maintaining as much of a narrow tech stack as possible.
                </p>

                <h2>Skills & Expertise</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>React:</strong> Building dynamic and responsive
                        user interfaces.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>TypeScript:</strong> Adding type safety and
                        enhancing code quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Node.js:</strong> Creating robust and scalable

                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe in the power of clean, efficient code and an
                    iterative development process. Collaboration and
                    communication are key to delivering high-quality products
                    that meet user needs and exceed expectations.
                </p>
